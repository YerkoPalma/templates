- **:raising_hand: Easy**: No programming skills needed, just markdown.
- **:rocket: Slides are PWAs**: Slides use service workers, so they are 
offline-first, also have a manifest, so they are installable.
- **:globe_with_meridians: p2p distributed**: Slides are automatically shared 
through Dat.
- **:nail_care: a11y friendly**: Slides are responsive, also controls. 
Optionally add _speech_ to your slides.
